            `Today I'd like to talk about life after being a full stack bootcamp for 6 months. I started
            this blog mainly to practice my coding skills with React and thought it would be great practice to use a full stack web page as a 
            blog serving a few purposes and helping me learn more along the way.
                I learnd alot about myself when pushing myself to the imits when it comes to coding, which is something I never did working on my CS degree.
                This class did help me writing code as a true from of art that I thought I would never see when it comes to developing a application. 
                After class ended the work never stopped for me, for myself I felt now I had
                more time to work on some stuff I wanted, only working longer hours and obsessing over code that I enjoyed writing. I just recently started to open myself to more future jobs
                joining an open source project and applying to some jobs here and there. `,

            `Since some people ask my technology background, Ive always been obsessed with computers sice I was little.
            I took a few maintence classes in high school becasue that's all we had at the time, late 90's. I went to college and became a CS majpr and ws introduced tp Java
            , I thought it was like learnning chinease and just never understood it nad winded up dropping out. Ten years later I went back got into college and was determined to get that
            degree. So I start taking classes and guess what the curriculum uses? Java... So then I  knew im gonna have to learn it and I did graduated. While in school I also took classes on
            XML, HTML, C# SQL amd Matlab so I started to become easier to read code. `,

            `So far my expierence with React has been positive, I enjoy creating websites using components, themes and just barely after using it a couple of months starting to understand the power it holds.
            It was the last thing I learned in my boot camp and probably the best tenchnology that I enjoy using inawhile. I also create or attempt to design or code out a new react app almost everyday. If I like
            what I see I usually add more and more into the app, also leaving lots of unfinished projects that never had a chance.  Doing a  job search I see that other framworks like Angular and Vue are still very much in demand
            , but at least for a little bit longer Im gonna do deeper and deeper into the React rabbit hole. `,
